       "  'readme_contents': '# Movies Application\\n\\nFor this project, we will be building a single page movie application (SPA). It\\nwill allow users to add, edit, and delete movies, as well as rate them. We will\\nbe using [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock a\\ndatabase and our backend, so that we can just worry about the front end and AJAX\\nrequests.\\n\\nThe webpack dev server is configured to watch for changes both in the javascript\\nsource, as well as the `public` directory. Whenever changes are detected, the\\npage will be reloaded. It will also proxy any requests that start with `/api` to\\nlocalhost:3000, which is where json-server is configured run.\\n\\n`json-server` is configured to have a delay of 1.2 seconds, so you can see what\\nyour application might actually look like, instead of serving instantaneous\\nreponses. You can modify this behavior by changing (or removing) the number\\nafter the `-d` flag inside of the npm `dev` script.\\n\\n## Setup\\n\\n1. Fork this repository to your own github account or your github organization.\\n\\n1. Clone your fork locally into your computer.\\n\\n1. Run `npm install`\\n\\n1. Run `npm run build`\\n\\n1. Run `npm run dev` and visit\\n   [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/) in your browser. Open up\\n   the console and inspect the output.\\n\\n## Development\\n\\nIn general, you should have the development web server (`npm run dev`) running\\nwhile you are working on the project. You should view your project through\\nhttp://localhost:1313, **not** from IntelliJ\\'s web server, or by dragging the\\nfile(s) into chrome. As you make changes to your source files, all you need to\\ndo is save the file, and the website will be live reloaded.\\n\\nTake a look at the `src/index.js` file to get started. You will notice it has\\nexamples of importing and requiring separate javascript files. Regardless of\\nwhich you choose to use, you should pick one and use it throughout your code\\nbase, don\\'t mix and match the two.\\n\\nThe file `src/api.js` also contains an example api request. You can\\nreference this to get started building out the parts of your application that\\ninteract with the api.\\n\\nThe `db.json` file contains your \"database\". You can edit this file directly to\\nmake changes to your data, and this file will be updated if you make api\\nrequests that modify the data.\\n\\nThe server will serve files from the `public` directory, meaning any files\\noutside of `public` will not be visible. This means if you have any frontend\\nassets (e.g. bootstrap, or images) they will need to be in the `public`\\ndirectory.\\n\\n## Specification\\n\\nYour application should:\\n\\nOn page load:\\n\\n- Display a \"loading...\" message\\n- Make an ajax request to get a listing of all the movies\\n- When the initial ajax request comes back, remove the \"loading...\" message\\n  and replace it with HTML generated from the json response your code\\n  receives\\n\\nAllow users to add new movies\\n\\n- Create a form for adding a new movie that has fields for the movie\\'s title\\n  and rating\\n- When the form is submitted, the page should **not** reload / refresh,\\n  instead, your javascript should make a POST request to `/api/movies` with the\\n  information the user put into the form\\n\\nAllow users to edit existing movies\\n\\n- Give users the option to edit an existing movie\\n- A form should be pre-populated with the selected movie\\'s details\\n- Like creating a movie, this should not involve any page reloads, instead\\n  your javascript code should make an ajax request when the form is\\n  submitted.\\n\\nDelete movies\\n\\n- Each movie should have a \"delete\" button\\n- When this button is clicked, your javascript should send a `DELETE` request\\n\\n### Bonuses\\n\\n- Add a `disabled` attribute to buttons while their corresponding ajax request\\n  is still pending.\\n- Show a loading animation instead of just text that says \"loading...\"\\n- Use modals for the creating and editing movie forms\\n- Add a `genre` property to every movie\\n- Allow users to sort the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you have it)\\n- Allow users to search through the movies by rating, title, or genre (if you\\n  have it)\\n\\n## Helpful Hints\\n\\n- The id property of every movie should not be edited by hand. The purpose of\\n  this property is to uniquely identify that particular movie. That is, if we\\n  want to delete or modify an existing movie, we can specify what movie we want\\n  to change by referencing it\\'s id. When a new movie is created (i.e.  when you\\n  send a `POST` request to `/api/movies` with a title and a rating), the server\\n  will respond with the movie object that was created, including a generated id.\\n- Take a look at the other branches in this repository, as they have\\n  configuration/setup for common scenarios, such as including bootstrap in your\\n  application.\\n'},\n",

These components are packaged as *bricks* 🧱, which provide\\nusers the building blocks they need to build pipelines targeted at the documents they care\\nabout. Bricks in the library fall into three categories:\\n\\n- :jigsaw: ***Partitioning bricks*** that break raw documents down into standard, structured\\n  elements.\\n- :broom: ***Cleaning bricks*** that remove unwanted text from documents, such as boilerplate and\\n  sentence\\n  fragments.\\n- :performing_arts: ***Staging bricks*** that format data for downstream tasks, such as ML inference\\n  and data labeling.\\n\\n<br></br>\\n\\n## :eight_pointed_black_star: Quick Start\\n\\nUse the following instructions to get up and running with `unstructured` and test your\\ninstallation. NOTE: We do not currently support python 3.11, please use an older version.\\n\\n- Install the Python SDK with `pip install \"unstructured[local-inference]\"`\\n\\t\\t- If you do not need to process PDFs or images, you can run `pip install unstructured`\\n- Install the following system dependencies if they are not already available on your system.\\n  Depending on what document types you\\'re parsing, you may not need all of these.\\n    - `libmagic-dev` (filetype detection)\\n    - `poppler-utils` (images and PDFs)\\n    - `tesseract-ocr` (images and PDFs)\\n    - `libreoffice` (MS Office docs)\\n- If you are parsing PDFs, run the following to install the `detectron2` model, which\\n  `unstructured` uses for layout detection:\\n    - `pip install tensorboard>=2.12.2`\\n    - `pip install \"detectron2@git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git@e2ce8dc#egg=detectron2\"`\\n\\nAt this point, you should be able to run the following code:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partition\\n\\nelements = partition(filename=\"example-docs/fake-email.eml\")\\nprint(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements]))\\n```\\n\\nAnd if you installed with `local-inference`, you should be able to run this as well:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partition\\n\\nelements = partition(\"example-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf\")\\nprint(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements]))\\n```\\n\\n## :dizzy: Instructions for using the docker image\\n\\nThe following instructions are intended to help you get up and running using Docker to interact with `unstructured`.\\nSee [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don\\'t already have docker installed on your machine.\\n\\nNOTE: we build multi-platform images to support both x86_64 and Apple silicon hardware. `docker pull` should download the corresponding image for your architecture, but you can specify with `--platform` (e.g. `--platform linux/amd64`) if needed.\\n\\nWe build Docker images for all pushes to `main`. We tag each image with the corresponding short commit hash (e.g. `fbc7a69`) and the application version (e.g. `0.5.5-dev1`). We also tag the most recent image with `latest`. To leverage this, `docker pull` from our image repository.\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker pull quay.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest\\n```\\n\\nOnce pulled, you can create a container from this image and shell to it.\\n\\n```bash\\n# create the container\\ndocker run -dt --name unstructured quay.io/unstructured-io/unstructured:latest\\n\\n# this will drop you into a bash shell where the Docker image is running\\ndocker exec -it unstructured bash\\n```\\n\\nYou can also build your own Docker image.\\n\\nIf you only plan on parsing one type of data you can speed up building the image by commenting out some\\nof the packages/requirements necessary for other data types. See Dockerfile to know which lines are necessary\\nfor your use case.\\n\\n```bash\\nmake docker-build\\n\\n# this will drop you into a bash shell where the Docker image is running\\nmake docker-start-bash\\n```\\n\\nOnce in the running container, you can try things out directly in Python interpreter\\'s interactive mode.\\n```bash\\n# this will drop you into a python console so you can run the below partition functions\\npython3\\n\\n>>> from unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf\\n>>> elements = partition_pdf(filename=\"example-docs/layout-parser-paper-fast.pdf\")\\n\\n>>> from unstructured.partition.text import partition_text\\n>>> elements = partition_text(filename=\"example-docs/fake-text.txt\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n## :coffee: Installation Instructions for Local Development\\n\\nThe following instructions are intended to help you get up and running with `unstructured`\\nlocally if you are planning to contribute to the project.\\n\\n* Using `pyenv` to manage virtualenv\\'s is recommended but not necessary\\n\\t* Mac install instructions. See [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#mac--homebrew) for more detailed instructions.\\n\\t\\t* `brew install pyenv-virtualenv`\\n\\t  * `pyenv install 3.8.15`\\n  * Linux instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/community#linux).\\n\\n* Create a virtualenv to work in and activate it, e.g. for one named `unstructured`:\\n\\n\\t`pyenv  virtualenv 3.8.15 unstructured` <br />\\n\\t`pyenv activate unstructured`\\n\\n* Run `make install`\\n\\n* Optional:\\n  * To install models and dependencies for processing images and PDFs locally, run `make install-local-inference`.\\n  * For processing image files, `tesseract` is required. See [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html) for installation instructions.\\n  * For processing PDF files, `tesseract` and `poppler` are required. The [pdf2image docs](https://pdf2image.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) have instructions on installing `poppler` across various platforms.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you\\'re planning to contribute to `unstructured`, we provide you an optional `pre-commit` configuration\\nfile to ensure your code matches the formatting and linting standards used in `unstructured`.\\nIf you\\'d prefer not having code changes auto-tidied before every commit, you can use  `make check` to see\\nwhether any linting or formatting changes should be applied, and `make tidy` to apply them.\\n\\nIf using the optional `pre-commit`, you\\'ll just need to install the hooks with `pre-commit install` since the\\n`pre-commit` package is installed as part of `make install` mentioned above. Finally, if you decided to use `pre-commit`\\nyou can also uninstall the hooks with `pre-commit uninstall`.\\n\\n## :clap: Quick Tour\\n\\nYou can run this [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1U8VCjY2-x8c6y5TYMbSFtQGlQVFHCVIW) to run the examples below.\\n\\nThe following examples show how to get started with the `unstructured` library.\\nYou can parse **TXT**, **HTML**, **PDF**, **EML**, **MSG**, **RTF**, **EPUB**, **DOC**, **DOCX**,\\n**ODT**, **PPT**, **PPTX**, **JPG**,\\nand **PNG** documents with one line of code!\\n<br></br>\\nSee our [documentation page](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured) for a full description\\nof the features in the library.\\n\\n### Document Parsing\\n\\nThe easiest way to parse a document in unstructured is to use the `partition` brick. If you\\nuse `partition` brick, `unstructured` will detect the file type and route it to the appropriate\\nfile-specific partitioning brick.\\nIf you are using the `partition` brick, you may need to install additional parameters via `pip install unstructured[local-inference]`. Ensure you first install `libmagic` using the\\ninstructions outlined [here](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured/installing.html#filetype-detection)\\n`partition` will always apply the default arguments. If you need\\nadvanced features, use a document-specific brick. The `partition` brick currently works for\\n`.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.eml`, `.msg`, `.html`, and `.pdf` documents.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partition\\n\\nelements = partition(\"example-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf\")\\n```\\n\\nRun `print(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements]))` to get a string representation of the\\noutput, which looks like:\\n\\n```\\n\\nLayoutParser : A Uniﬁed Toolkit for Deep Learning Based Document Image Analysis\\n\\nZejiang Shen 1 ( (cid:0) ), Ruochen Zhang 2 , Melissa Dell 3 , Benjamin Charles Germain Lee 4 , Jacob Carlson 3 , and\\nWeining Li 5\\n\\nAbstract. Recent advances in document image analysis (DIA) have been primarily driven by the application of neural\\nnetworks. Ideally, research outcomes could be easily deployed in production and extended for further investigation.\\nHowever, various factors like loosely organized codebases and sophisticated model conﬁgurations complicate the easy\\nreuse of im- portant innovations by a wide audience. Though there have been on-going eﬀorts to improve reusability and\\nsimplify deep learning (DL) model development in disciplines like natural language processing and computer vision, none\\nof them are optimized for challenges in the domain of DIA. This represents a major gap in the existing toolkit, as DIA\\nis central to academic research across a wide range of disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. This paper\\nintroduces LayoutParser , an open-source library for streamlining the usage of DL in DIA research and applica- tions.\\nThe core LayoutParser library comes with a set of simple and intuitive interfaces for applying and customizing DL models\\nfor layout de- tection, character recognition, and many other document processing tasks. To promote extensibility,\\nLayoutParser also incorporates a community platform for sharing both pre-trained models and full document digiti- zation\\npipelines. We demonstrate that LayoutParser is helpful for both lightweight and large-scale digitization pipelines in\\nreal-word use cases. The library is publicly available at https://layout-parser.github.io\\n\\nKeywords: Document Image Analysis · Deep Learning · Layout Analysis · Character Recognition · Open Source library ·\\nToolkit.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nDeep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of document image analysis (DIA) tasks\\nincluding document image classiﬁcation [11,\\n```\\n\\n### HTML Parsing\\n\\nYou can parse an HTML document using the following workflow:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.html import partition_html\\n\\nelements = partition_html(\"example-docs/example-10k.html\")\\nprint(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements[:5]]))\\n```\\n\\nThe print statement will show the following text:\\n```\\nUNITED STATES\\n\\nSECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\\n\\nWashington, D.C. 20549\\n\\nFORM 10-K\\n\\nANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934\\n```\\n\\nAnd `elements` will be a list of elements in the HTML document, similar to the following:\\n\\n```python\\n[<unstructured.documents.elements.Title at 0x169cbe820>,\\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x169cbe8e0>,\\n <unstructured.documents.elements.NarrativeText at 0x169cbe3a0>]\\n```\\n\\n### PDF Parsing\\n\\nYou can use the following workflow to parse PDF documents.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.pdf import partition_pdf\\n\\nelements = partition_pdf(\"example-docs/layout-parser-paper.pdf\")\\n```\\n\\nThe output will look the same as the example from the document parsing section above.\\n\\n\\n### E-mail Parsing\\n\\nThe `partition_email` function within `unstructured` is helpful for parsing `.eml` files. Common\\ne-mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Gmail support exporting e-mails as `.eml` files.\\n`partition_email` accepts filenames, file-like object, and raw text as input. The following\\nthree snippets for parsing `.eml` files are equivalent:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.email import partition_email\\n\\nelements = partition_email(filename=\"example-docs/fake-email.eml\")\\n\\nwith open(\"example-docs/fake-email.eml\", \"r\") as f:\\n  elements = partition_email(file=f)\\n\\nwith open(\"example-docs/fake-email.eml\", \"r\") as f:\\n  text = f.read()\\nelements = partition_email(text=text)\\n```\\n\\nThe `elements` output will look like the following:\\n\\n```python\\n[<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLNarrativeText at 0x13ab14370>,\\n<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLTitle at 0x106877970>,\\n<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLListItem at 0x1068776a0>,\\n<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLListItem at 0x13fe4b0a0>]\\n```\\n\\nRun `print(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements]))` to get a string representation of the\\noutput, which looks like:\\n\\n```python\\nThis is a test email to use for unit tests.\\n\\nImportant points:\\n\\nRoses are red\\n\\nViolets are blue\\n```\\n\\n### Text Document Parsing\\n\\nThe `partition_text` function within `unstructured` can be used to parse simple\\ntext files into elements.\\n\\n`partition_text` accepts filenames, file-like object, and raw text as input. The following three snippets are for parsing text files:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom unstructured.partition.text import partition_text\\n\\nelements = partition_text(filename=\"example-docs/fake-text.txt\")\\n\\nwith open(\"example-docs/fake-text.txt\", \"r\") as f:\\n  elements = partition_text(file=f)\\n\\nwith open(\"example-docs/fake-text.txt\", \"r\") as f:\\n  text = f.read()\\nelements = partition_text(text=text)\\n```\\n\\nThe `elements` output will look like the following:\\n\\n```python\\n[<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLNarrativeText at 0x13ab14370>,\\n<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLTitle at 0x106877970>,\\n<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLListItem at 0x1068776a0>,\\n<unstructured.documents.html.HTMLListItem at 0x13fe4b0a0>]\\n```\\n\\nRun `print(\"\\\\n\\\\n\".join([str(el) for el in elements]))` to get a string representation of the\\noutput, which looks like:\\n\\n```python\\nThis is a test document to use for unit tests.\\n\\nImportant points:\\n\\nHamburgers are delicious\\n\\nDogs are the best\\n\\nI love fuzzy blankets\\n```\\n\\n\\n## :guardsman: Security Policy\\n\\nSee our [security policy](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/security/policy) for\\ninformation on how to report security vulnerabilities.\\n\\n## :books: Learn more\\n\\n| Section | Description |\\n|-|-|\\n| [Company Website](https://unstructured.io) | Unstructured.io product and company info |\\n| [Documentation](https://unstructured-io.github.io/unstructured) | Full API documentation |\\n| [Batch Processing](Ingest.md) | Ingesting batches of documents through Unstructured |\\n'},\n",

Install [Anaconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)\\n\\n* [Linux](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh)\\n* [MacOSX](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)\\n* [Windows](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)\\n\\nIf you\\'re installing Anaconda3 using a GUI, be sure to check the box that updates your PATH variable.\\nAlso, at the end, the Anaconda3 installer will ask if you want to install VSCode.\\nMicrosoft\\'s VSCode is a decent Python editor/linter if you\\'re willing to send your data to Microsoft to enable all the linting features.\\n\\nSome of us prefer Sublime Text 3 to the open source IDEs like Atom and VSCode. In Sublime you can get complete linting and spellchecking and auto-delinters for free, even in offline mode (no intrusive data slurping or EULA).\\n\\n### Step 2. Install an Editor\\n\\nYou can skip this step if you are happy using `jupyter notebook` or `VSCode` or `Spyder` (built into Anaconda).\\n\\nI like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).\\nIt\\'s a lot cleaner and more mature than the alternatives.\\nPlus it has more plugins written by individual developers like you.\\n\\n### Step 3. Install Git and Bash\\n\\n* Linux -- already installed\\n* MacOSX -- already installed\\n* [Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\\n\\nIf you\\'re on Linux or Mac OS, you\\'re good to go. Just figure out how to launch a terminal and make sure you can run `ipython` or `jupyter notebook` in it. This is where you\\'ll play around with your own NLP pipeline.\\n\\n#### Windows\\n\\nOn Windows you have a bit more work to do. Supposedly Windows 10 will let you install Ubuntu with a terminal and bash. But the terminal and shell that comes with [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is probably a safer bet. It\\'s maintained by a broader open source community.\\n\\nYou need to make sure your `PATH` variable includes a path to `conda`, `python` and other command line apps installed by Anaconda. This can sometimes be set with something like this:\\n\\n```\\necho \"PATH=$HOME/Anaconda3/bin:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\\n```\\n\\nor\\n\\n```bash\\necho \"PATH=/c/Users/$USER/AppData/Local/Continuum/Anaconda3/:$PATH\" >> ~/.bashrc\\n```\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to make sure you new MINGW64 terminal is launched with `winpty` to trick windows into treating the `MINGW64` terminal (git-bash) like a standards-compliant TTY terminal application. So add these aliases to your `~/.bashrc` from within your git-bash terminal:\\n\\n```bash\\necho \"alias python=\\'winpty python\\'\" >> ~/.bashrc\\necho \"alias jupyter=\\'winpty jupyter\\'\" >> ~/.bashrc\\necho \"alias ipython=\\'winpty ipython\\'\" >> ~/.bashrc\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Step 4. Clone this repository\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia.git\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5. Install `nlpia`\\n\\nYou have two alternative package managers you can use to install `nlpia`:\\n\\n5.1. [`conda`](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/README.md#alternative-51-conda)\\n5.2. [`pip`](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/README.md#alternative-52-pip)\\n\\nA helpful [NLPIA](http://bit.ly/gh-readme-nlpia-book) reader, [Hoang Chung Hien](https://github.com/hoangchunghien), created a Dockerfile you can use for a third way to manage your environment:\\n\\n5.3. [`docker`](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/README.md#alternative-53-docker)\\n\\nIn most cases, `conda` will be able to install python packages faster and more reliably than `pip`. Without `conda` Some packages, such as `python-levenshtein`, require you to compile a C library during installation. Windows doesn\\'t have a a compiler and python package installer that will \"just work.\"\\n\\n#### Alternative 5.1. `conda`\\n\\nUse `conda` (from the Anaconda3 package that you installed in Step 1 above) to create an environment called `nlpiaenv`:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd nlpia  # make sure you\\'re in the nlpia directory that contains `setup.py`\\nconda env create -n nlpiaenv -f conda/environment.yml\\nconda install -y pip  # to get the latest version of pip\\nconda activate nlpiaenv\\npip install -e .\\n```\\n\\nWhenever you want to be able to import or run any `nlpia` modules, you\\'ll need to activate this conda environment first:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ conda activate nlpiaenv\\n```\\n\\nOn **Windows** CMD prompt (Anaconda Prompt in Applications) there is no source command so:\\n\\n```dos\\nC:\\\\ activate nlpiaenv\\n```\\n\\nNow make sure you can import nlpia with:\\n\\n```bash\\npython -c \"print(import nlpia)\"\\n```\\n\\nSkip to Step 6 (\"Have fun!\") if you have successfully created and activated an environment containing the `nlpia` package and its dependencies.\\n\\n#### Alternative 5.2. `pip`\\n\\nYou can try this first, if you\\'re feeling lucky:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd nlpia\\npip install --upgrade pip\\npip install -e .\\n```\\n\\nOr if you don\\'t think you\\'ll be editing any of the source code for nlpia and you don\\'t want to contribute to the community here you can just:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install nlpia\\n```\\n\\nLinux-based OSes like Ubuntu and OSX come with C++ compilers built-in, so you may be able to install the dependencies using pip instead of `conda`.\\nBut if you\\'re on Windows and you want to install packages, like `python-levenshtein` that need compiled C++ libraries, you\\'ll need a compiler.\\nFortunately Microsoft still lets you [download a compiler for free](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers#Microsoft_Visual_C.2B-.2B-_14.0_standalone:_Visual_C.2B-.2B-_Build_Tools_2015_.28x86.2C_x64.2C_ARM.29), just make sure you follow the links to the Visual Studio \"Build Tools\" and not the entire Visual Studio package.\\n\\nOnce you have a C/C++ compiler and the python source code files, you can install `nlpia` using pip:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd nlpia  # make sure you\\'re in the nlpia directory that contains `setup.py`\\npip install --upgrade pip\\nmkvirtualenv nlpiaenv\\nsource nlpiaenv/bin/activate\\npip install -r requirements-test.txt\\npip install -e .\\npip install -r requirements-deep.txt\\n```\\n\\nThe chatbots(including TTS and STT audio drivers) that come with `nlpia` may not be compatible with Windows due to problems installing `pycrypto`.\\nIf you are on a Linux or Darwin(Mac OSX) system or want to try to help us debug the pycrypto problem feel free to install the chatbot requirements:\\n\\n```bash\\n# pip install -r requirements-chat.txt\\n# pip install -r requirements-voice.txt\\n```\\n\\n## Alternative 5.3. `docker`\\n\\n### 5.3.1. Build your image\\n\\nThis might take a few minutes to download the jupyter docker image:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker build -t nlpia .\\n```\\n\\n### 5.3.2. Run your image\\n\\n- `docker run -p 8888:8888 nlpia`\\n- Copy the `token` obtained from the run log\\n- Open Browser and use the link `http://localhost:8888/?token=...`\\n\\n### 5.3.3. Play around\\n\\nIf you want to keep your notebook file or share a folder with the running container then use:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run -p 8888:8888 -v ~:/home/jovyan/work nlpia\\n```\\n\\nThen open a new notebook and test your code. Make sure save it inside `work` directory so it\\'s accessible outside the container.\\n\\n### 6. Have Fun!\\n\\nCheck out the code examples from the book in `nlpia/nlpia/book/examples` to get ideas:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd nlpia/book/examples\\nls\\n```\\n\\nHelp other NLP practitioners by contributing your code and knowledge.\\n\\nBelow are some nlpia feature ideas others might find handy. Contribute your own ideas to https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/issues .\\n\\n#### 6.1. Feature 1: Glossary Compiler\\n\\nSkeleton code and APIs that could be added to the https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/transcoders.py:`transcoders.py` module.\\n\\n\\n```python\\ndef find_acronym(text):\\n    \"\"\"Find parenthetical noun phrases in a sentence and return the acronym/abbreviation/term as a pair of strings.\\n\\n    >>> find_acronym(\\'Support Vector Machine (SVM) are a great tool.\\')\\n    (\\'SVM\\', \\'Support Vector Machine\\')\\n    \"\"\"\\n    return (abbreviation, noun_phrase)\\n```\\n\\n```python\\ndef glossary_from_dict(dict, format=\\'asciidoc\\'):\\n    \"\"\" Given a dict of word/acronym: definition compose a Glossary string in ASCIIDOC format \"\"\"\\n    return text\\n```\\n\\n```python\\ndef glossary_from_file(path, format=\\'asciidoc\\'):\\n    \"\"\" Given an asciidoc file path compose a Glossary string in ASCIIDOC format \"\"\"\\n    return text\\n\\n\\ndef glossary_from_dir(path, format=\\'asciidoc\\'):\\n    \"\"\" Given an path to a directory of asciidoc files compose a Glossary string in ASCIIDOC format \"\"\"\\n    return text\\n```\\n\\n#### 6.2. Feature 2: Semantic Search\\n\\nUse a parser to extract only natural language sentences and headings/titles from a list of lines/sentences from an asciidoc book like \"Natural Language Processing in Action\".\\nUse a sentence segmenter in https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/transcoders.py:[nlpia.transcoders] to split a book, like _NLPIA_, into a seequence of sentences.\\n\\n#### 6.3. Feature 3: Semantic Spectrograms\\n\\nA sequence of word vectors or topic vectors forms a 2D array or matrix which can be displayed as an image. I used `word2vec` (`nlpia.loaders.get_data(\\'word2vec\\')`) to embed the words in the last four paragraphs of Chapter 1 in NLPIA and it produced a spectrogram that was a lot noisier than I expected. Nonetheless stripes and blotches of meaning are clearly visible.\\n\\nFirst, the imports:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from nlpia.loaders import get_data\\n>>> from nltk.tokenize import casual_tokenize\\n>>> from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\\n>>> import seaborn\\n```\\n\\nFirst get the raw text and tokenize it:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> lines = get_data(\\'ch1_conclusion\\')\\n>>> txt = \"\\\\n\".join(lines)\\n>>> tokens = casual_tokenize(txt)\\n>>> tokens[-10:]\\n[\\'you\\',\\n \\'accomplish\\',\\n \\'your\\',\\n \\'goals\\',\\n \\'in\\',\\n \\'business\\',\\n \\'and\\',\\n \\'in\\',\\n \\'life\\',\\n \\'.\\']\\n```\\n\\nThen you\\'ll have to download a word vector model like word2vec:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> wv = get_data(\\'w2v\\')  # this could take several minutes\\n>>> wordvectors = np.array([wv[tok] for tok in tokens if tok in wv])\\n>>> wordvectors.shape\\n(307, 300)\\n```\\n\\nNow you can display your 307x300 spectrogram or \"wordogram\":\\n\\n```python\\n>>> plt.imshow(wordvectors)\\n>>> plt.show()\\n```\\n\\n[![307x300 spectrogram or \"wordogram\"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totalgood/nlpia/master/docs/ch1_conclusion_spectrogram.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/totalgood/nlpia/master/docs/ch1_conclusion_spectrogram.png)\\n\\nCan you think of some image processing or deep learning algorithms you could run on images of natural language text?\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve mastered word vectors you can play around with Google\\'s Universal Sentence Encoder and create spectrograms of entire books.\\n\\n#### 6.4. Feature 4: Build your own Sequence-to-Sequence translator\\n\\nIf you have pairs of statements or words in two languages, you can build a sequence-to-sequence translator.  You could even design your own language like you did in gradeschool with piglatin or build yourself a L337 translator.\\n\\nOr you could create a universal sentence embedding using `dfs = [get_data(lang) for lang in nlpia.loaders.ANKI_LANGUAGES]` and then replacing the movie character chatbot dataset in Chapter 10 with these translation pairs, one at a time. Start with a fresh clean decoder for each new language. That way you\\'ll have a separate decoder that you can use to translate into any language. But you want to reuse the encoder so that you end up with a Universal thought vector for encoding English sentences. This will be similar to Google\\'s Unversal Sentence Encoding, but yours will be character-based so it can handle mispelled English words.\\n\\n#### Other Ideas\\n\\nThere are a lot more project ideas mentioned in the \"Resources\" section at the end of the NLPIA Book. Here\\'s an early draft of [that resource list](https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/data/book/Appendix%20E%20--%20Resources.asc.md).\\n\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

API. Pipelines group together a pretrained model with the preprocessing that was used during that model\\'s training. Here is how to quickly use a pipeline to classify positive versus negative texts:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis\\n>>> classifier = pipeline(\\'sentiment-analysis\\')\\n>>> classifier(\\'We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.\\')\\n[{\\'label\\': \\'POSITIVE\\', \\'score\\': 0.9996980428695679}]\\n```\\n\\nThe second line of code downloads and caches the pretrained model used by the pipeline, while the third evaluates it on the given text. Here the answer is \"positive\" with a confidence of 99.97%.\\n\\nMany tasks have a pre-trained `pipeline` ready to go, in NLP but also in computer vision and speech. For example, we can easily extract detected objects in an image:\\n\\n``` python\\n>>> import requests\\n>>> from PIL import Image\\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\\n\\n# Download an image with cute cats\\n>>> url = \"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\"\\n>>> image_data = requests.get(url, stream=True).raw\\n>>> image = Image.open(image_data)\\n\\n# Allocate a pipeline for object detection\\n>>> object_detector = pipeline(\\'object-detection\\')\\n>>> object_detector(image)\\n[{\\'score\\': 0.9982201457023621,\\n  \\'label\\': \\'remote\\',\\n  \\'box\\': {\\'xmin\\': 40, \\'ymin\\': 70, \\'xmax\\': 175, \\'ymax\\': 117}},\\n {\\'score\\': 0.9960021376609802,\\n  \\'label\\': \\'remote\\',\\n  \\'box\\': {\\'xmin\\': 333, \\'ymin\\': 72, \\'xmax\\': 368, \\'ymax\\': 187}},\\n {\\'score\\': 0.9954745173454285,\\n  \\'label\\': \\'couch\\',\\n  \\'box\\': {\\'xmin\\': 0, \\'ymin\\': 1, \\'xmax\\': 639, \\'ymax\\': 473}},\\n {\\'score\\': 0.9988006353378296,\\n  \\'label\\': \\'cat\\',\\n  \\'box\\': {\\'xmin\\': 13, \\'ymin\\': 52, \\'xmax\\': 314, \\'ymax\\': 470}},\\n {\\'score\\': 0.9986783862113953,\\n  \\'label\\': \\'cat\\',\\n  \\'box\\': {\\'xmin\\': 345, \\'ymin\\': 23, \\'xmax\\': 640, \\'ymax\\': 368}}]\\n```\\n\\nHere we get a list of objects detected in the image, with a box surrounding the object and a confidence score. Here is the original image on the left, with the predictions displayed on the right:\\n\\n<h3 align=\"center\">\\n    <a><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\\n    <a><img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/coco_sample_post_processed.png\" width=\"400\"></a>\\n</h3>\\n\\nYou can learn more about the tasks supported by the `pipeline` API in [this tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/task_summary).\\n\\nIn addition to `pipeline`, to download and use any of the pretrained models on your given task, all it takes is three lines of code. Here is the PyTorch version:\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\\n>>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\\n\\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\\n```\\n\\nAnd here is the equivalent code for TensorFlow:\\n```python\\n>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModel\\n\\n>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\\n>>> model = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained(\"bert-base-uncased\")\\n\\n>>> inputs = tokenizer(\"Hello world!\", return_tensors=\"tf\")\\n>>> outputs = model(**inputs)\\n```\\n\\nThe tokenizer is responsible for all the preprocessing the pretrained model expects, and can be called directly on a single string (as in the above examples) or a list. It will output a dictionary that you can use in downstream code or simply directly pass to your model using the ** argument unpacking operator.\\n\\nThe model itself is a regular [Pytorch `nn.Module`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) or a [TensorFlow `tf.keras.Model`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model) (depending on your backend) which you can use as usual. [This tutorial](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) explains how to integrate such a model into a classic PyTorch or TensorFlow training loop, or how to use our `Trainer` API to quickly fine-tune on a new dataset.\\n\\n## Why should I use transformers?\\n\\n1. Easy-to-use state-of-the-art models:\\n    - High performance on natural language understanding & generation, computer vision, and audio tasks.\\n    - Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners.\\n    - Few user-facing abstractions with just three classes to learn.\\n    - A unified API for using all our pretrained models.\\n\\n1. Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:\\n    - Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining.\\n    - Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs.\\n    - Dozens of architectures with over 60,000 pretrained models across all modalities.\\n\\n1. Choose the right framework for every part of a model\\'s lifetime:\\n    - Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code.\\n    - Move a single model between TF2.0/PyTorch/JAX frameworks at will.\\n    - Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation and production.\\n\\n1. Easily customize a model or an example to your needs:\\n    - We provide examples for each architecture to reproduce the results published by its original authors.\\n    - Model internals are exposed as consistently as possible.\\n    - Model files can be used independently of the library for quick experiments.\\n\\n## Why shouldn\\'t I use transformers?\\n\\n- This library is not a modular toolbox of building blocks for neural nets. The code in the model files is not refactored with additional abstractions on purpose, so that researchers can quickly iterate on each of the models without diving into additional abstractions/files.\\n- The training API is not intended to work on any model but is optimized to work with the models provided by the library. For generic machine learning loops, you should use another library (possibly, [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate)).\\n- While we strive to present as many use cases as possible, the scripts in our [examples folder](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples) are just that: examples. It is expected that they won\\'t work out-of-the box on your specific problem and that you will be required to change a few lines of code to adapt them to your needs.\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n### With pip\\n\\nThis repository is tested on Python 3.6+, Flax 0.3.2+, PyTorch 1.3.1+ and TensorFlow 2.3+.\\n\\nYou should install 🤗 Transformers in a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). If you\\'re unfamiliar with Python virtual environments, check out the [user guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).\\n\\nFirst, create a virtual environment with the version of Python you\\'re going to use and activate it.\\n\\nThen, you will need to install at least one of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow.\\nPlease refer to [TensorFlow installation page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/), [PyTorch installation page](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) and/or [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax#quick-install) and [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) installation pages regarding the specific installation command for your platform.\\n\\nWhen one of those backends has been installed, 🤗 Transformers can be installed using pip as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install transformers\\n```\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to play with the examples or need the bleeding edge of the code and can\\'t wait for a new release, you must [install the library from source](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/installation#installing-from-source).\\n\\n### With conda\\n\\nSince Transformers version v4.0.0, we now have a conda channel: `huggingface`.\\n\\n🤗 Transformers can be installed using conda as follows:\\n\\n```shell script\\nconda install -c huggingface transformers\\n```\\n\\nFollow the installation pages of Flax, PyTorch or TensorFlow to see how to install them with conda.\\n\\n> **_NOTE:_**  On Windows, you may be prompted to activate Developer Mode in order to benefit from caching. If this is not an option for you, please let us know in [this issue](https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface_hub/issues/1062).\\n\\n## Model architectures\\n\\n**[All the model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models)** provided by 🤗 Transformers are seamlessly integrated from the huggingface.co [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models) where they are uploaded directly by [users](https://huggingface.co/users) and [organizations](https://huggingface.co/organizations).\\n\\nCurrent number of checkpoints: ![](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/models&color=brightgreen)\\n\\n🤗 Transformers currently provides the following architectures (see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_summary) for a high-level summary of each them):\\n\\n1. **[ALBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/albert)** (from Google Research and the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago) released with the paper [ALBERT: A Lite BERT for Self-supervised Learning of Language Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942), by Zhenzhong Lan, Mingda Chen, Sebastian Goodman, Kevin Gimpel, Piyush Sharma, Radu Soricut.\\n1. **[ALIGN](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/align)** (from Google Research) released with the paper [Scaling Up Visual and Vision-Language Representation Learning With Noisy Text Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05918) by Chao Jia, Yinfei Yang, Ye Xia, Yi-Ting Chen, Zarana Parekh, Hieu Pham, Quoc V.
